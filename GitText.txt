This is a text file
Okay so for this second commit I will just add some more text to this file
OKay I think I am getting the hang of the commiting and adding changes to staging. I think my next stage should be making a new branch and then merging it into the main branch

I have successfully switched between both branches

I have now added a new branch.

And now I have merged them. However there was a conflict during merge due to both additions being on the same line. 

I have fixed this using vim. 

Okay, so I think I have successfully worked through branching and commiting in git now. As well as establishing a connection with GitHub to push your commits
